# Java Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of Java programming exercises I have worked on, which cover various topics such as basic operations, control structures, loops, and more advanced algorithms like prime numbers, Armstrong numbers, and recursion.

## Table of Contents

1. **Basic Operations**
   - Swapping two numbers, checking if a number is even or odd, determining if a number is prime or not, etc.
   
2. **Control Flow**
   - Programs using `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to perform operations like classification of characters, checking eligibility for different age-based conditions, etc.

3. **Mathematical Operations**
   - Programs involving factorial, power of a number, finding the greatest common divisor (GCD/HCF), calculating combinations, and determining perfect numbers.

4. **Patterns**
   - Creating different patterns using loops, like number pyramids, inverted triangles, and more complex shapes.

5. **Recursion**
   - Some problems are solved using recursion, such as calculating factorial, Fibonacci series, and more.

## Problem Breakdown

### 1. **Basic Operations**
   - **Swapping Two Numbers**: A program that swaps two numbers using a third variable.
     - File: `swap.java`
   - **Character Classification**: Classifies a character as a capital letter, small letter, or special symbol.
     - File: `char.java`
   - **Odd or Even Check**: Checks if a number is odd or even.
     - File: `loc.java`

### 2. **Control Flow**
   - **Age Classification**: Determines if a person is a major, minor, or senior citizen.
     - File: `age.java`
   - **FizzBuzz Program**: Prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for both.
     - File: `fb.java`

### 3. **Mathematical Operations**
   - **Prime Numbers**: Checks if a number is prime.
     - File: `prime.java`
   - **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a number.
     - File: `factorial.java`
   - **Fibonacci Series**: Prints the Fibonacci series up to a certain number.
     - File: `fibonacci.java`

### 4. **Patterns**
   - **Number Patterns**: Prints different patterns using numbers like stars, sequences, and more complex shapes.
     - File: `pattern.java`

### 5. **Recursion**
   - **Factorial Using Recursion**: Calculates factorial recursively.
     - File: `factorial_recursive.java`
   - **Fibonacci Series Using Recursion**: Prints Fibonacci series using recursion.
     - File: `fibonacci_recursive.java`

## How to Run

To run any program:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the Java file is located.
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java <filename>
   ```

For example, to run the program that swaps two numbers:
```bash
javac swap.java
java swap
```
