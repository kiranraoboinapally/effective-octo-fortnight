1.Swapping Two numbers using third variable(without scanner )?
fileName= swap.java
2.Write a Java program that takes a character as input and classifies it as either a "Capital Letter", "Small Letter", or "Special Symbol". 
If the character is between 'A' and 'Z', print "Capital Letter"; if it's between 'a' and 'z', print "Small Letter"; otherwise, print "Special Symbol".

fileName= age.java
5.Accept a number as input if its divisible by 3 print fizz,if its divisible by 5 print buzz,
if its both print fizz and buzz?
fileName=fb.java
6.Switch Case to do ???why break & why continue?? why not if else??

7.Take age as input and check whether it is +ve or -ve.If it is +ve check age>18
print eligible for job if age>21 print he is eligible for upsc
if he is>18 & <21 eligible for ssc exams if age<18 he is not eligible to apply?

8.Take 3 numbers as input and find the largest among them?
fileName=   large.java
9.using ternary operator to add or subtract?

16.Print 3 table as 3X1=3......3X10=30
fileName=t1.java
17.Print 3 table and find the result is prime or not?

18.Check the result is even or odd?
3X1=3 odd 3X2=6 even......

19.Check how many even numbers in 3 table and odd numbers
print even numbers are 5
print odd numbers are 5

20.Take num=3 as input 
if the input is even then num=num/2 else if input is odd num=3*num+1
output 10 5 16 8 4 2 1


21.Fibonacci Series if input a=0 and b=1 then output
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 //c=a+b


22.Power a number without using Math.pow()


23.Print only Last digit in the range of 10 to 20 numbers
fileName= l1.java


24.Print Square roots of 1 to 10 numbers



25.Print perfect square numbers in the range of 1 to 100


26.Print Leap Years in the range of 1900 to 2024


27.Print fizz and buzz i.e divisible by 3 and 5 in the range of 1000 to 100 print with numbers as fizz and buzz



28.Sum of Even numbers in 1 to 100 range



29.nCr Problem



30.Factors of a number


31.Perfect Number find Factors of a number and sum those factors  
Example factors for 6 are 1,2,3 not including 6 then adding those numbers 1+2+3=6 taken input are equal said to be perfect number



32.Count Number of Factors to a taken input


33.Check whether taken input is a prime or not?


34.take input as any number example 20
output 20 19 18 17.....11 1 2 3.....10
